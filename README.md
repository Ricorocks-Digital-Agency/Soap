## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or greater
- Laravel 8.16 or greater

## Installation

You can install the package via composer

```bash
composer require ricorocks-digital-agency/soap
```

> Note: As of v1.5.0 Soap requires PHP ^7.4

## Using Soap

Soap can be accessed through the provided Facade

```php
use RicorocksDigitalAgency\Soap\Facades\Soap

Soap::to()
```

## Features/API

### Headers

You can set the headers for each soap request that will be passed to the Soap Client using the `withHeaders` method.

```php
Soap::to('...')->withHeaders(...$headers)->call('...');
```

Each header should be a `Header` instance, which provides a fluent interface for constructing a new [PHP Soap Header](https://www.php.net/manual/en/soapheader.construct.php) and can be composed as follows:
```php
$header = Soap::header()
            ->name('Authentication')
            ->namespace('test.com')
            ->data([
                'user' => '...',
                'password' => '...'
            ])
            ->mustUnderstand()
            ->actor('foo.co.uk')
```
This can also be expressed as:
```php
$header = Soap::header('Authentication', 'test.com', [
                'user' => '...',
                'password' => '...'
            ])
            ->mustUnderstand()
            ->actor('foo.co.uk')
```
Plus, the `soap_header` helper method can be used:
```php
$header = soap_header('Authentication', 'test.com')
            ->data([
                'user' => '...',
                'password' => '...'
            ])
```
> The `data` for the header can either be an array or a `SoapVar`, as per the `SoapHeader` constructor
#### Global Headers
Soap allows you to set headers that should be included for every request:
```php
Soap::headers(...$headers)
```
Again, each header should be an instance of `Header`.

You may also want to include headers on every request, but only for a certain endpoint or action:

```php
// Only requests to this endpoint will include these headers
Soap::headers(soap_header('Auth', 'test.com'))->for('https://api.example.com');

// Only requests to this endpoint and the method Customers will include these headers
Soap::headers(soap_header('Brand', 'test.com'))->for('https://api.example.com', 'Customers');
```

These calls are usually placed in the `boot` method of one of your application's Service Providers.
### To

The endpoint to be accessed

```php
Soap::to('github.com/api')
```

### Functions

Retrieve the functions the endpoint provides

```php
Soap::to('github.com/api')->functions()
```

This is a wrapper for the PHP SoapClient `_getFunctions()` method.


### Call

Call the method at the endpoint.

```php
Soap::to('github.com/api')->call('merge')
```

The method can also be called as a Magic Method.

```php
Soap::to('github.com/api')->merge()
```

#### Parameters

The [Call](#call) method of course accepts parameters.
The parameters passed can be an array

```php
Soap::to('github.com/api')->call('merge', ['branch' => 'staging', 'credentials' => ['password' => '...'])
```
##### Nodes

To simplify dealing with SOAP XML in your requests, Soap provides a method to fluently construct the nodes in the request.

For example, say the following node was desired in the XML request. Note it has no body.

```xml
<PullRequest branch="dev" target="main">
</PullRequest>
```

The `array` to pass to the underlying php `SoapClient` to construct this node would be as follows

```php
'PullRequest' => [
    '_' => '',
    'branch' => 'dev',
    'target' => 'main'
]
```
The `_` is required to set the information not as the body, but as the attributes for the node.

However, this is not required if the XML node has a body.

```xml
<PullRequest branch="dev" target="main">
    <Author>Ricorocks</Author>
</PullRequest>
```
Now, the `array` would be as follows

```php
'PullRequest' => [
    'Author' => 'Ricorocks',
    'branch' => 'dev',
    'target' => 'main'
]
```
So, to prevent confusion, the `Soap::node()` will allow for intelligent construction of the php `array` to be passed to `SoapClient`.

Imagine we are accessing the `information` method to see details about Pull Requests

```php
Soap::to('...')
    ->information('PullRequest' => soap_node(['branch' => 'dev', 'target' => 'main']))

'PullRequest' => [
    '_' => '',
    'branch' => 'dev',
    'target' => 'main'
]

Soap::to('...')
    ->information('PullRequest' => soap_node(['branch' => 'dev', 'target' => 'main'])->body(['Author' => 'Ricorocks']))

'PullRequest' => [
    'Author' => 'Ricorocks',
    'branch' => 'dev',
    'target' => 'main'
]
```
Now, just by adding or removing a body to the `soap_node()` the outputted array is intelligently constructed.

A node can be made with either the Facade `Soap::node()` or the helper method `soap_node()`.

### Options

You can set custom options for each soap request that will be passed to the Soap Client using the `withOptions` method.

```php
Soap::to('...')->withOptions(['soap_version' => SOAP_1_2])->call('...');
```

> See [https://www.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.construct.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.construct.php)
for more details and available options.

Soap also provides a number of methods that add syntactical sugar to the most commonly used options, which are detailed
below.

#### Tracing
Soap allows you to easily trace your interactions with the SOAP endpoint being accessed.

To trace all requests, set the following in the register method of your `ServiceProvider`:

```php
Soap::trace()
```
Now, all `Response` objects returned will have a `Trace` object attached, accessible via `$response->getTrace()`. This has four properties which are wrappers for the respective methods found on the `SoapClient`:
- `xmlRequest` (`__getLastRequest`)
- `xmlResponse` (`__getLastResponse`)
- `requestHeaders` (`__getLastRequestHeaders`)
- `responseHeaders` (`__getLastResponseHeaders`)

Tracing can also be declared locally:
```php
Soap::to('...')->trace()->call('...')
```
Now, just this `Response` will have a valid `Trace`.

Tracing is null safe. If `$response->getTrace()` is called when a `Trace` hasn't been set, a new `Trace` is returned. This `Trace`'s properties will all return `null`.

#### Authentication

You can authenticate using Basic or Digest by calling `withBasicAuth` and `withDigestAuth` respectively.

```php
Soap::to('...')->withBasicAuth('username', 'password')->call('...');
Soap::to('...')->withDigestAuth('username', 'password')->call('...');
```

#### Global Options

Sometimes, you may wish to include the same set of options on every SOAP request. You can do that using the `options`
method on the `Soap` facade:

```php
// Every request will include these options automatically
Soap::options(['login' => 'foo', 'password' => 'bar']);
```

You may also want to include options on every request, but only for a certain endpoint or action:

```php
// Only requests to this endpoint will include these options
Soap::options(['login' => 'foo', 'password' => 'bar'])->for('https://api.example.com');

// Only requests to this endpoint and the method Customers will include these options
Soap::options(['login' => 'foo', 'password' => 'bar'])->for('https://api.example.com', 'Customers');
```

These calls are usually placed in the `boot` method of one of your application's Service Providers.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to perform actions before and after Soap makes a request.
These hooks can be local (per request), or global (applied to every request).

You can make changes to the `Request` object in `beforeRequesting` hooks if you wish. These changes will be reflected in the actual request. In fact, this is how the Soap `include` functionality works.

### Local

To create a local hook, chain `beforeRequesting` or `afterRequesting` to a `Request` object:

```php
Soap::to('http://example.com')
	->beforeRequesting(fn() => Log::info('Request going in!'))
	->afterRequesting(fn() => Log::info('Request coming out!'))
	->call('Action', []);
```

Any before requesting hooks will receive the request as a parameter
and after requesting hooks will receive the request and response
as a parameter.

### Global

To create a global hook, use the `Soap::beforeRequesting` and `Soap::afterRequesting` methods.

```php
Soap::beforeRequesting(fn() => Log::info('Request going in!'));
Soap::afterRequesting(fn() => Log::info('Request coming out!'));
```

Any before requesting hooks will receive the request as a parameter
and after requesting hooks will receive the request and response
as a parameter.

## Faking

Soap includes full support for faking endpoints and actions, as well as
inspecting requests and responses.

To fake all SOAP requests, call `Soap:fake()`. This will return an empty
response for every request. It is likely that you will want to be more
specific, so you can pass the `fake` method an array of endpoints as keys
and response objects as values:

```php
Soap::fake(['http://endpoint.com' => Response::new(['foo' => 'bar'])]);
```

In the above example, any SOAP request made to `http://endpoint.com` will
be faked, and a `Response` object with a body of `['foo' => 'bar']` will
be returned instead.

What if you want to specify the SOAP action too? Easy! Just add `:{ActionName}` after your endpoint, like so:

```php
Soap::fake(['http://endpoint.com:Details' => Response::new(['foo' => 'bar'])]);
```
Now, only SOAP requests to the `Details` actions will be mocked.

You can also specify multiple actions with the `|` operator:
```php
Soap::fake(['http://endpoint.com:Details|Information|Overview' => Response::new(['foo' => 'bar'])]);
```
Now, only SOAP requests to the `Details`, `Information` and `Overview` actions will be mocked.


### Inspecting requests

If you've made a call to `Soap::fake()`, Soap will record all requests made. You can then inspect these requests as you see fit.

#### `Soap::assertSentCount($count)`

If you just want to assert that `n` amount of SOAP requests were sent,
you can use this method, passing in the desired count as a parameter.

#### `Soap::assertSent(callable $callback)`

You can dive a little deeper and test that a particular request was
actually sent, and that it returned the expected response. You should
pass a closure into this method, which receives the `$request` and `$response` as parameters, and return `true` if they match your
expectations.

#### `Soap::assertNotSent(callable $callback)`

This is the opposite of `Soap::assertSent`. You can make sure that a
particular request wasn't made. Again, returning `true` from the
closure will cause it to pass.

#### `Soap::assertNothingSent()`

If you just want to make sure that absolutely nothing was sent out, you
can call this. It does what it says on the tin.

## Configuration

Configuration of Soap is via the `Soap` facade in the `boot()` method in your service provider.

### Include

Parameters can be set to be automatically included in all requests. These can be `arrays` or [nodes](#nodes)

```php
Soap::include(['credentials' => soap_node(['user' => '...', 'password' => '...'])]);
```

You can even use dot syntax on your array keys to permeate deeper into the request body.

```php
Soap::include(['login.credentials' => soap_node(['user' => '...', 'password' => '...'])]);
```

Often, you'll want to target specific endpoints or actions. You can chain the `for` method to achieve this.

```php
// Only requests to https://api.example.com will include this data
Soap::include(['credentials' => soap_node(['user' => '...', 'password' => '...'])])->for('https://api.example.com');

// Only requests to https://api.example.com calling the Customers method will include this data
Soap::include(['credentials' => soap_node(['user' => '...', 'password' => '...'])])->for('https://api.example.com', 'Customers');
```


## Ray Support

This package comes with first party support for Ray, an awesome debugging tool by Spatie! We offer a couple of methods that you
can use to start debugging immediately.

> Obviously, you'll need Ray installed in your project for this to work.

### `ray()->showSoapRequests()`
This enables Ray support in the SOAP package. Any SOAP requests made will be recorded in the Ray
app for you to inspect.

### `ray()->stopShowingSoapRequests()`
This disables Ray support in the SOAP package. Requests will stop being recorded if previously
enabled.

> If you want to use the Ray integration inside of your tests, remember to register the `RayServiceProvider` along
with your other providers.
